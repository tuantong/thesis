Thesis - Multi-objective optimization for fuzzy clustering algorithm

Utilized Bellman-Zadeh principle and Global Criterion Method for compromise among Cluster Validity Indices (CVI) for fuzzy k-means algorithm. This new approach has been proved effective by examining with some famous data sets. Finally, deployed the above model to identify Representative Load Curves for power system.

I included herein my MATLAB code for the thesis
